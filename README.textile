h1. maven plugins for jruby

p. this is fork of http://github.com/jruby/jruby and it basically did some better naming (in my opinion) and added spec goal. allow to reuse AbstactJrubyMojo in other projects and show how to do it in gem-maven-plugin

h2. my problem with maven vs. gem

p. both project try to solve the same problems. I just wrote a gem for jruby only, now I need to include some java code as a jar file and I depend on 3rd party jars. what shall I do ? pack them all up with the gem. but then I loose all dependency info from my jars and I cannot share them and I might run into version conflicts later since for the gem a packed jar file is just file like any ruby file.

p. pending: this is an attempt to make gem artifact, make maven use gemcutter (or any other gem repository) extract a minimal pom from the gemspec.

h2. current status

p. featurewise is this basically identical with the maven plugin from the jruby project.
